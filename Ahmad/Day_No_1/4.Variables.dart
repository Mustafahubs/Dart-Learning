Syntax os variables in dart.

How to make and store values in dart?
Answer:- 

"var" is a short from of variable that used in the starting point in different type of variables:-
next write the varibale name then equal to write values of varibales.

For Example:- */

// here variable name contains value "Muhammad Ahmad".
// var name = "Muhammad Ahmad"

// here the another example of variables

var x = 1;
var y = 2;
var z = x + y;


// Keep In Mind When you are using the void main() method then you need to call also this 
// variables or another function.

// check this..
 void main() {
//Declaring Variables
String name = "Muhammad Ahmad";
String address = "Pakisatn";  
num age = 20; // used to store any types of numbers 
num height = 5.7;
bool isMarried = false;
   
// printing variables value 

/* we are use f string in python for call variable in string. But in the dart we need to
 use $ dollar sign at the starting point of the variable. Then we can see it works like 
 f string.
 Let's try it now:- */

print("Name is $name");
print("Address is $address");
print("Age is $age");
print("Height is $height");
print("Married Status is $isMarried");

// print the plus of x and y.
print('\n');
// print('');
print("Answer:- $z");
}

// run it and check the outputs
